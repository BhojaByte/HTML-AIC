                Generative AI refers to a class of algorithms that can generate new content, such as images, text, or even entire pieces of music, based on patterns and data it has learned during training. Unlike traditional AI models that are rule-based and deterministic, generative models exhibit a level of creativity and unpredictability, making them invaluable tools for various applications.

                    <h1 style="font-size: 15px; font-weight: 400; color: white;">Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):</h1>
    GANs consist of two neural networks, a generator, and a discriminator, pitted against each other in a constant feedback loop. The generator creates content, and the discriminator evaluates it. This adversarial process continues until the generator produces content that is indistinguishable from real data.

<h1 style="font-size: 15px; font-weight: 400; color: white;">Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):</h1>
    VAEs work by learning the underlying structure of input data and then generating new data points by sampling from the learned distribution. These models are widely used in applications where generating diverse and realistic content is crucial.
